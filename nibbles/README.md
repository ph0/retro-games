Nibbles(A Java applet)
======================

(Please note:- You would need the latest JRE to play this game) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nibbles is a snake. Nibbles is hungry. Nibbles eats circles. Nibbles is growing and it is very fragile. Help Nibbles reach its food as Nibbles has very poor sense of smell and doing that also make sure that it does not hit a wall or collides with its own body.

To play this game, click on the start button(or press and release the space bar) then use the all four directional keys to direct the Nibbles to the morsel of food and while doing that make sure that Nibbles never hit a wall or its own body. Nibbles will die if it does get a hit. To replay the game refresh the page.

Nibbles is alive and very well at http://hackers.pk and it is written by, Sohail Qayum Malik
